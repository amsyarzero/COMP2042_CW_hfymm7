# Changes
## Ball
- Changed variable names (`center` to `ballCenter`)
- Removed the extra methods (`wall.setBallXSpeed` and `wall.setBallYSpeed`) so `DebugPanel` now uses the existing methods (`ball.setXSpeed` and `ball.setYSpeed`) in `Ball.java` instead
- Spaced out brackets and commas for clarity
- Changed ball colour to fully black for theming

## BlackBall (formerly RubberBall)
- Changed class name for accuracy to ball colour
- Changed ball colour to black for theming
- Spaced out brackets and commas for clarity

## Brick, BrickOne, BrickTwo, BrickThree
- Changed names of `ClayBrick.java`, `CementBrick.java`, and `SteelBrick.java` to `BrickOne.java`, `BrickTwo.java`, and `BrickThree.java`
- Changed colour of the three bricks
- Changed order of `CEMENT` and `STEEL` in `Wall.java` so it reflects accurately
- Spaced out brackets and commas for clarity

## BrickFour
**Special level that is similar to levels featuring BrickTwo and BrickThree**.

The file is similar to the other bricks.

## Crack
- Put `Crack` class into its own file called `Crack.java` (original file had `Crack` inside `Brick.java`, which is fine, but that's too much responsibility for a single class)

- Spaced out the brackets and commas for clarity
